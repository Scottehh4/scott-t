								<h4>Code Monkey Studios</h4>
								<p>Code Monkey's was my entry back into the development world. They were looking for a Junior Developer to come in and perform front end work. I had just left a Network Support Helpdesk and was looking for a career change. Having done Development in the past, I decided to apply. I undertook several projects during my time at Code Monkey's, the biggest been a command and control center for a major auxiliary ambulance service serving the Manchester area. I learnt JavaScript whilst here too, and jQuery to go with that. I had a lot of control over projects and essentially became a project manager for all ongoing and upcoming projects. I left Code Monkey's to seek further knowledge. I wanted to have a senior developer above me that I could learn from and improve my skill-set even further.</p>

								<h4>Ultima Furniture Systems</h4>
								<p>Ultima Furniture Systems are an exclusively online bespoke Kitchen manufacturer with a Â£30 million per year turnover. At Ultima I was employed to design and implement an in-house order processing system to be used on the factory floor, when loading vehicles and by drivers during delivery. I was often undertaking multiple projects at a time and expanding my knowledge daily. This employment came to an end as when I was initially hired, I was promised support from senior developers when required and a set amount of time each week to expand my knowledge and skills. None of these promises were held, and I hit a bit of a stalling point in my career so decided in order to progress, I needed to move.</p>

								<h4>Zaxity Ltd</h4>
								<p>Zaxity are a small application development company based in Leeds. During my time there, I jumped onto several projects simultaneously based around the web advert marketplace. I spend a considerable amount of time expanding my knowledge and learning new frameworks like SailsJS, Angular 1 &amp; 2, NodeJS, ReactJS and also started learning Python. I had a lot of spare time at Zaxity due to demand for work dropping off. It was for this reason that Zaxity and I decided it was time to head our seperate ways. I wasn't getting the exposure to projects as I initially wanted, and they we're hemorrhaging money to pay my wages. A reference from Zaxity can be obtained if required.</p>

							<h3>Web Development</h3>

							<p class="desc">
								The Front End is my core area. I am confident in using most frameworks, like Angular, Node &amp; React, even if I haven't learnt them fully yet. I enjoy taking on a challenge and I don't bother trying to hide areas where I lack knowledge from potential employers. I'm as honest as they come, if I can't do it, or have never tried before, I will say so and then either the task can be assigned to someone else with more experience, or if possible, I can be supported throughout by a senior and take on the challenge myself.

							<h3>UI/UX Design</h3>  

							<p class="desc">
								I possess skills with Adobe software and can bring ideas to life through Photoshop/Illustrator. I am not going to claim I'm a guru in this area, all my skills within this area are self taught, but I think you'd be impressed with my knowledge despite this. This website was designed before been written, and as you can see, it's quite impressive. I tend to think about user experience whilst designing and how I can show all functionality easily and make it understandable within what I create.

							<h3>Branding</h3>

							<p class="desc">
								Branding is an important part of the "development lifestyle". Companies change, they Pivot, things sometimes need to change. I am a creative individual and always having ideas, whether it be for a new app that I could develop, or something that can improve my daily tasks. This means that I can also be crucial when it comes to trying to think of rebranding options for clients, or whether I need to be creative and think outside the box to blow their socks off.

							<h3>Learning</h3>

							<p class="desc">
								Everything I know as a developer is self taught. This means I am still learning, and part of that learning is identifying weaknesses and putting together plans to improve on them. My current weakness is when it comes to testing methodologies. I am actively looking at ways to improve on this. I want to be able to constantly identify my weak points and where I can improve, as I believe that if I know where the weakness is, I can constantly be learning and improving. Testing is my next port of call in this regard.

							<h3>Development Lifecycle</h3>

							<p class="desc">
								I understand the development lifecycle. I understand what is important, how projects should be tackled &amp; can also provide input when deciding the best way to proceed with a proposed project. I see the lifecycle as:</p>

							<ul class="list-unstyled">
								<li>1. Plan</li>
								<li>2. Analyse</li>
								<li>3. Design</li>
								<li>4. Develop</li>

								<li>6. Implement</li>
								<li>7. Maintain</li>

						<div class="service-content">

							<h3>Frameworks</h3>

							<p class="desc">
								I have worked with several frameworks in the past few years, all of which I have learnt on my own accord. I have worked with front end frameworks like Angular 1 and ReactJS. I have also worked with a few backend frameworks, like SailsJS and NodeJS. On top of all that, I have started to learn Angular 2 and Typescript as I like to be up to date with all the current technologies. I am in no way shape or form a guru in these areas, all I have learnt has been self taught and I would class myself at a Junior level with these, but I am always looking for ways to improve and expand my knowledge.
